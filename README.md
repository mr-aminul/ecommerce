# CustomEcom Admin Dashboard

Hey! 👋 This is **CustomEcom Admin Dashboard**, a Next.js-based ecommerce admin panel built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and Tailwind CSS. I made this for devs who want a clean, modern, and actually customizable dashboard for their store, without all the corporate bloat.

## What is this?
A simple, open-source ecommerce admin dashboard. You get:
- **Products**: List, create, and view product details
- **Orders**: See and manage orders
- **Customers**: View your customer list
- **Settings**: Store/account/notification/display settings

All pages are ready to be tweaked, extended, or ripped apart for your own needs. No backend, just UI and client-side logic. You can wire it up to your own API or database.

## Why?
Most dashboards out there are either too opinionated, too ugly, or too hard to customize. I wanted something that:
- Looks good out of the box (thanks shadcn/ui)
- Is easy to hack on
- Doesn't force you into a specific stack
- Lets you build your own thing, fast

## Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (for all the UI components)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) for icons
